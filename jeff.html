            <div class="essay-text">
                <p>A few days ago I found out that Jeff Rigsby was dead. A friend of mine sent me a Twitter post reporting that his body had been found in Kabul and that he had likely been murdered. "Holy shit," my friend said. "Didn't you know this guy?"</p>

                <p>Indeed I had known Jeff Rigsby. We were not the closest of friends; I reckon that I saw him fewer than a dozen times in total. I'm not sure if we had more than twenty conversations. The last time we had spoken -- the last time we will ever have spoken -- was eight months before he died; and it struck me that because that conversation and many others prior were associated with two inaccessible Twitter accounts -- one deleted, the other belonging to a dead man -- that all records of those conversations are effectively struck from the earth. Even when he was alive it was hard to find information about him. In some number of years the Twitter account that constituted the bulk of his presence in the world of others will disappear for one reason or another; some obscure glimpses of him will remain in articles no one will read, and eventually he will disappear from the minds of men and it will be as though he never existed. Thus is the way of all flesh.</p>

                <p>I did not expect that Jeff's death would make me so sad. Part of it was the suddenness; he did not occupy a prominent enough place in my memory for me to think that he was mortal and would one day perish like all mortals do. For me Jeff Rigsby was one of those background characters whom one encounters in a single episode of the meandering picaresque that constitutes a life; and I just never really gave him enough thought to realize that he, too, could die.</p>

                <p>And I was provided little consolation by the facts of his death. The thought that he had died violently was appalling. Thankfully I discovered it wasn't true; friends of his told me that he had died of a stroke or a heart attack in an apartment in Kabul where he had lived alone. And so the horror of violence was replaced by the horror of loneliness. There was no one there when he died, his friends told me, and no one had discovered his body for ten days. I could only imagine the body starting to rot before someone -- perhaps a neighbor alerted by the smell, perhaps a friend realizing he had been silent for more than a week: that was a long time for Jeff to be silent! -- entered the apartment and discovered the corpse that once was Jeff.</p>

                <p>I had first met Jeff through Twitter, when I was preparing to go to Afghanistan in late 2022. I knew that he lived in Kabul; I reckoned that he was the only American who continued to live permanently in Kabul after the Taliban took over. I didn't quite know what he did. In some articles he is billed as an "investment consultant," but my understanding was that he was simply a lifelong expatriate who lived in one of the cheapest cities in the world and had neither a conventional career nor a conventional family life. Perhaps "freelance researcher" is a better descriptor. He had lived in Afghanistan before, in the years of the war, working for USAID and as a military contractor doing development projects of one kind or another; and so it was strange that he would decide to return after the Taliban had triumphed in 2021. But he did return, and he made Kabul his final home.</p>

                <p>I have only a vague understanding of his life prior to my meeting him in Kabul. He had gone to Harvard for undergrad, graduating sometime in the early '90s; there is an old <i>Harvard Crimson</i> article attributed to him on Rawls. After Harvard he lived a basically peripatetic life, spending time in various developing countries. At some point he had owned a large farm in Ethiopia with the idea of developing the country's agricultural exports, only for civil war to make the plan infeasible. He lived in the cheapest of countries and earned, where he could, in dollars; and so regular work was never such a necessity. I never had a good idea of what he wanted out of life. Why would a Harvard graduate be spending time in this backwater of backwaters? His life was lived in pursuit of goals and ideals I did not understand, things he never elucidated. But I recognized that he was clearly very intelligent and passionate about his areas of focus; he clearly loved Afghans even as he was willing to criticize them harshly; and he was congenitally scrupulous and fair. He really did dedicate the last years of his life to improve a wretched country, a country that rarely treated him well. There was much to commend him.</p>

                <p>On Twitter Jeff had built a niche as an honest and sober commentator on Afghan affairs, one of the relatively few Westerners with any idea what they were talking about. It helped that he actually lived in the country. In his writings Jeff focused on the mundane and crucial aspects of development -- irrigation, currency management, electricity, road-building, population health -- that practically everyone else ignored: he exhaustively covered the issues preventing the country from receiving new currency that the pre-Taliban republic had ordered from a Polish manufacturer and the saga of Afghanistan's central bank reserves, billions of dollars that might help an impoverished nation develop. He talked about basic failings of governance that could be corrected, and bemoaned basic issues like lead exposure and shoddy medicine. Lead exposure was a particular focus for him; the publicity he gave to the link between aluminum pressure cookers and lead poisoning will, I believe, improve a lot of lives in Afghanistan. At least I hope so.</p>

                <p>Jeff was very intentional in the topics he chose to discuss. In his politics he was a Western liberal; I recall him mentioning that he had favored Pete Buttigieg in 2020. But he did not condemn the Taliban's restrictions on the rights of women in the way that other Western commentators did. He clearly opposed it; but he thought it was useless to try to persuade the Taliban of the virtues of an Enlightenment-derived moral framework of which they were either unfamiliar or contemptuous. The Taliban could be reasoned with, including on issues like the rights of women; but you had to present a logic that worked within the world they knew. You had to show why your suggestions would make the country better -- stronger, richer, healthier -- rather than why they would bring a country that fundamentally rejected the tenets of Western modernity into compliance with Western mores and dictates. In a piece that makes casual reference to Kant, Rawls, Nozick, and Bernard Williams, Jeff wrote:</p>

                <p>"The Taliban nowadays take social media seriously, so Twitter dunking is absolutely a valid form of resistance to their rule. But their international critics have more than one option today. They can tweet: 'Banning girls from school is immoral, according to an ethical framework invented during the European Enlightenment and codified in international human rights conventions.' Or they can tweet: 'Banning girls from school will make Afghanistan weaker.' Which is more likely to have some practical effect? ... Regardless of their gender, angry people who are visibly helpless to affect the situation are unlikely to inspire much respect in their adversaries. And if their anger is motivated by an abstract political doctrine their adversaries don't share, it's unlikely even to evoke much comprehension. You have to meet people where they are."</p>

                <p>Because of this approach the Taliban was rather open to Jeff's advice. It was practical, earnest, and humane. Here was an American who was intelligent, who cared about the country (enough even to live in it!), who sought to contribute his knowledge where it would be useful for improving people's lives -- even as he made clear that his own worldview could not have been further from that of the Talibs. He was more than willing to criticize them, and in some cases they gave him blunt reminders that he was a guest in <i>their</i> country; I recall that he got in trouble a few times, though nothing too serious. Jeff made enemies of many of those opposed to the Taliban, too, because he was willing to give the Emirate credit where it had succeeded, recognized that many popular foreign NGOs were likely engines for embezzlement, and pointed out that plenty of anti-Taliban reporting was fake (like the <i>Guardian</i> reporting the killing of a gay man who never existed). After his death became public knowledge many opposed to the Taliban celebrated and spread rumors about the circumstances of his demise.</p>

                <p>Toward the end of his life -- not that he <i>knew</i> it would be the end of his life -- his contributions in Afghanistan became the major project of his existence. When I met him he had not been back home in years; I'm not sure if he went back before his death. He was living out of a hotel called the Intercontinental; we met over a breakfast of biscuits and bad coffee, and spent a few days talking frequently, walking around Kabul. At some point we spoke to a school for girls of the Hazara ethnic minority, in a rather dangerous neighborhood of Kabul; I remember that all the girls wanted to learn English and get out of Afghanistan, and we sat on the floor with the principal and ate something like macaroni and cheese. I don't remember what Jeff said; I don't remember what I said.</p>

                <p>As I recall, he spoke decent Persian but not much Pashto; he tended not to wear the <i>kurta</i> that Afghan men wear. Usually he dressed in collared shirts and jeans. Jeff had plenty of Afghan friends, but with them he spoke about Afghan issues. He did not share much of his inner life. He was not close to his family in North Carolina and never mentioned any romantic relationships. There were some rumors that he was gay and closeted, but I never spoke to him about it.</p>

                <p>He was a basically solitary individual; around the edges of his conversations you could detect some melancholy. At some point, I saw, he shared a quote from Doris Lessing that "what people really want" is "just one other person I could really talk to, who could really understand me, who'd be kind to me." For Jeff I was not that person. I talked with him almost exclusively about Afghanistan and its problems; he told me stories about drugged-up suicide bombers in the war years, fraudulent NGOs, poisonous medicines; and in the years after our brief time in Kabul we texted infrequently over Twitter or Telegram. Over time we texted less and less. When I found out that he was dead I had not thought about him in months. I did not expect to be so affected by it.</p>

                <p>I won't lie to myself or to the reader and say that this eulogy of sorts sums up Jeff, for I knew him poorly; and beside all eulogies are pale beside the experience of any life. Our time in each other's company was brief and professional. I do not know if Jeff will have a funeral or if much else will be written in his memory, and if those words written in his memory will come from those who knew him: since his life and death won't fit into any narratives of much convenience I find it doubtful. He had a life that has now ended; and we will never know what that life was for itself, for we can see his life only as a stranger might see our own lives: dimly, mercilessly, carelessly. I will not pretend that his contributions will survive long in the minds of others, for he labored for purposes obscure to the outside world and for causes that are in all likelihood doomed; but he lived and now does not, and once could be counted among the ranks of my friends and now cannot. He was a good man, and I will miss him.</p>

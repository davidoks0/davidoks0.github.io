                <p class="section-title">I. Brown, Bachelier, Einstein</p>
                <p>In the year 1827, a botanist by the name of Robert Brown observed something strange.</p> 
                
                <p>In the year 1900, the mathematician Louis Bachelier – a student of the great Henri Poincaré, the most prominent mathematician of his time – defended his doctoral thesis, <i>Théorie de la spéculation</i>: "The Theory of Speculation." From the standpoint of the early twenty-first century we can recognize Bachelier&rsquo;s contribution as a major achievement. In his dissertation Bachelier elucidated the first mathematical model of the continuous-time stochastic process that we call Brownian motion and applied it to the problem of valuing stock options. Bachelier predated, by five years, the celebrated work of the <i>annus mirabilis</i> in which Einstein provided the first theory of Brownian motion and showed that Brownian motion and heat diffusion were governed by the same underlying mathematics. And yet in his time Bachelier&rsquo;s achievement would go unheralded. Despite the fame of his mentor, his dissertation met with a stony reception; he there seemed to be little appetite for the application of mathematics to such rudely practical matters. In spite of this he received a passing grade. Bachelier would have a rather undistinguished academic career at various provincial universities – Dijon, Rennes, Besançon – before dying in 1946.</p>

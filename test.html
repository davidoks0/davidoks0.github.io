                <p>There's something peculiar about the way we talk about technology. When we discuss artificial intelligence, we often reach for metaphors about engines and cameras—mechanical tools that extend our capabilities in predictable ways. An engine amplifies our physical strength; a camera enhances our ability to capture and preserve visual information. But these metaphors, while comforting in their familiarity, may be increasingly inadequate for understanding the systems we're building.</p>
                
                <p>Consider the difference between a camera and the human eye. A camera captures exactly what's in front of it, preserving a moment with mechanical precision. The human eye, in contrast, works in constant collaboration with the brain, actively constructing our visual experience. It doesn't just record—it interprets, fills in gaps, makes predictions, and sometimes even sees things that aren't there. This distinction becomes crucial when we think about artificial intelligence, because many of our AI systems are beginning to operate more like eyes than cameras.</p>
                
                <p>The engine metaphor similarly falls short. An engine converts one form of energy into another according to fixed principles—it's predictable, mechanical, and fundamentally straightforward in its operation. But modern AI systems often exhibit behaviors that seem to emerge from their training rather than from explicit programming. They surprise us not just in their failures but in their successes, finding novel solutions that their creators hadn't anticipated. This emergent behavior suggests we might need new metaphors—perhaps drawn from biology or ecology—to better understand these systems.</p>
